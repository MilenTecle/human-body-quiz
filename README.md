 - I used some of this code to create a modal box and to make it work accordingly: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp.
 
 - I used code from this video to accurately create the answer buttons and create the text found in my PresentQuestions function. I also used code from the same video to reset the answers with a while loop, found in my resetAnswers function: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBcqGxrr9g8.

 - I used code from this video to sort the questions in a randomized order with the sort method: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k. I also used code from the same video to connect right and wrong answers to the corresponing answers buttons.
